      <p class="bold">The Nonbinary Umbrella</p>
      <p>While the label of being nonbinary is something people can identify to in and of itself, some people choose to identify as other identities that still can fall under the nonbinary identity. A few examples are:</p>

    <article class="textAlignRight" id="yellowBG">
      <img class="imageLeft" src="../images/genderfluid_flag.png" width=100% alt='The genderfluid flag' >
      <p class="bold">Genderfluid</p>
      <p>The genderfluid identity basically entails that someone identifies as different genders at different times. It's dependent on a lot of factors which could vary on the person. These changes could happen at any given interval, and ultimately it's going to be up to the person and how they're feeling at any given time.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="textAlignLeft" id="grayBG">
      <img class="imageRight" src="../images/agender_flag.png" width=100% alt='The agender flag' >
      <p class="bold">Agender</p>
      <p>This identity entails that someone identifies with no gender at all, or a gender that isn't male or female at all. Some people consider it as a lack of a gender identity, while some consider it to be a gender identity.</p>
      <p>It could also be another umbrella term that could lead into other identities below it, but for sake of brevity it isn't listed down here.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="textAlignRight" id="whiteBG">
      <img class="imageLeft" src="../images/demigender_flag.png" width=100% alt='The demigender flag' >
      <p class="bold">Demigender</p>
      <p>This identity entails that someone partially identifies as a gender, but not fully. It doesn't really have to be a gender someone predominantly identify as, as long as it's a gender someone partially identifies with.</p>
      <p>Similarly to the agender identity, demigender is also an umbrella term, with identities like demigirl, demiboy, deminonbinary, and a lot more.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="textAlignLeft" id="yellowBG">
      <p>These are only three of the many gender identities that could fall under the nonbinary identity. At the same time, however, someone could identify as one of these identities without identifying as nonbinary. In this regard, again, it's very important to ask.</p>
