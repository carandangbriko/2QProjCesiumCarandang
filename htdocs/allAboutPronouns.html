      <p>Especially in this day and age, it's important to ask people what pronouns they go by. Even though it may seem to be something you can find out at first glance, there never really is a way to really find out without asking, even outside the topic of being nonbinary.</p>

      <p>Typically, the pronouns "he" and "she" get commonly used when referring to a person. While those are the most common, there are other pronouns in the English dictionary that get used to refer to a person, examples being the singular "they", "it", and "one". Aside from these, there are things called "neopronouns", which are pronouns not officially recognized in an English dictionary, but do still tend to get used as pronouns. These can be just about anything, which may seem a bit odd to some, but they're just as valid to use as any other pronoun, despite them not being in an English dictionary.</p>

      <p>While people tend to stick to one pronoun to refer to them as, it's not uncommon for some to opt to use two or more pronouns to refer to themselves interchangeably. For example, someone can use "he" and "she" interchangeably, or "he" and "they", or "she" and "they", and it would be perfectly alright to do so.</p>

      <p>As a final note, it's worth noting that pronouns don't automatically equate to gender. For example, while "he" tends to be used in more masculine contexts, someone identifying as a female could still use the pronoun "he" for whatever reason they want to. This is a big reason why it's that important to ask someone what pronouns to refer to them as.</p>
