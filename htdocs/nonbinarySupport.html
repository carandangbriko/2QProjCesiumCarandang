      <p class="bold">Supporting a Nonbinary Friend</p>
      <p>So what if you find out that someone, be it a friend, a family member, or anyone you know, comes out as nonbinary? Here are a couple of tips, just coming from me, to help you give some support to a nonbinary friend you know!</p>
    </article>
    <article class="textAlignRight" id="yellowBG">
      <p class="bold">1. Recognize and respect their identity</p>
      <p>Whether it be their gender identity itself, or the pronouns they use, it's very important to recognize and respect their identity. Even if it takes a while to get used to, you should at least make an attempt to try. Gender dysphoria, or the dissatisfaction of a particular part of gender experience, is a very common thing that happens to nonbinary people, and at the very least, you can try to minimize it happening.</p>

    <article class="textAlignLeft" id="purpleBG">
      <p class="bold">2. Encourage and validate them</p>
      <p>More often than not, a nonbinary person could feel a bit afraid to be proud of who they are. There are a lot of factors surrounding this, like pre-existing beliefs, the community someone's in, and a lot more. It helps a lot to encourage someone's gender identity and help them feel valid in society because of things like these.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="textAlignRight" id="white BG">
      <p class="bold">3. Keep an open mind</p>
      <p>Keeping an open mind is important, especially with dealing with concepts like these. If anything in this site is something that strikes you as new information, I implore you to do your own research on the topic. These concepts have been aroound for a while, though it's only now that there's light being shed on a lot of them.</p>
      <p>This site aims to help more with shedding light on this topic, and I sincerely hope it has!</p>
